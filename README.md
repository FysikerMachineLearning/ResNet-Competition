# ResNet-Competition
The ResNet Competition was proposed by Max Karlstr√∂m (`maxterk`).

## Assignment
* Goal: Best accuracy
* Dataset: MNIST
* Architectures: MLP, [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
* Constraints: Maximum of 10000 parameters
* Theory: Understand why DenseNet is the next logical step after ResNet
* Format: Jupyter Notebook

### Make a branch
Make a branch from master to store your intermediate work. When finished you make a new branch with the final file named `<your-username>.ipynb` and make a pull request.

### Useful links
* [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
* [Managing conda environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
* [Miniconda download](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

### Dependencies
The code should use
* Python 3.6
* Tensorflow 1.11
* Numpy 1.15

This is equivalent of using the conda environment specified by `enviroment.yml`.
